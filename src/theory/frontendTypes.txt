Great question! In frontend development, there are several types of web applications based on how they render content, load resources, and handle navigation. Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of the main types:

‚ö°Ô∏è 1. SPA (Single Page Application)
What it is: Only a single HTML page is loaded. All content updates happen via JavaScript without reloading the page.

Examples: React, Vue, Angular apps.

Pros:

Fast, smooth user experience

No full-page reloads

Cons:

SEO can be tricky

Initial bundle size might be large

üß† 2. MPA (Multi-Page Application)
What it is: Each page is a separate HTML file; navigation triggers full-page reloads.

Examples: Traditional websites like e-commerce, blogs, or older PHP/Java-based web apps.

Pros:

Great for SEO

Simple to implement

Cons:

Slower navigation due to full page reloads

Shared state between pages is harder

‚öôÔ∏è 3. SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
What it is: HTML is rendered on the server and sent to the browser. JavaScript takes over for interactivity (hydration).

Examples: Next.js, Nuxt.js

Pros:

Great for SEO

Fast first load

Cons:

More server resources

More complex infrastructure

üß≥ 4. SSG (Static Site Generation)
What it is: HTML is pre-rendered at build time and served statically (like a blog or documentation site).

Examples: Next.js (with getStaticProps), Gatsby, Hugo

Pros:

Super fast

Low server load (can use CDN)

Cons:

Not ideal for dynamic content

Need rebuilds for every content change

üîÅ 5. ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
What it is: A hybrid of SSG + SSR. Some static pages update in the background at a set interval.

Examples: Next.js (with revalidate in getStaticProps)

Pros:

Great balance between speed and freshness

Cons:

Still tied to framework support (mainly Next.js)

üîå 6. PWA (Progressive Web App)
What it is: A web app that behaves like a native app (can work offline, be installed, etc.)

Examples: Twitter Lite, Pinterest

Pros:

Works offline

Can be installed on devices

Cons:

Needs proper service worker setup

Not supported fully on iOS (yet)

 Bonus: Micro-Frontend Apps
What it is: Frontend broken into independently deployable pieces (like microservices for frontend).

Examples: Multiple teams work on parts of a UI like a dashboard

Pros:

Scalable across teams

Independent deployments

Cons:

Complex architecture and communication between pieces
